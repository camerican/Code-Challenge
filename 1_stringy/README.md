# Code Challenge #1: Stringy

Write a function named stringy that takes a size and returns a string of alternating `1s` and `0s`. the string should start with a 1. a string with size 6 should return :`101010`. with size 4 should return : `1010`. with size 12 should return : `101010101010`. 

The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers, though it's possible the user may enter in a floating point number we would have to convert to a whole number.

Hint: Math.floor
