# Code Challenge #5: Email Validation

Write a function to test whether a given input is a valid email address.  For the purposes of this assessment, here is what makes a valid email: 
* At least one letter character at the beginning 
* All characters between the first character and the @ (if any) must be letters, numbers, underscores, or periods
* There must be an @ character (after the points listed just now) 
* After the @ character, there must be at least one word character (letter, number, or underscore) or hyphen 
* The email must end with at least one set of a period followed by one or more word characters. 
* The input must NOT be case-sensitive.

The function should return true or false.
