# Fibonacci Sequence

Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two sequence numbers. Below is an example of the sequence `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, …` Notice the sequence pattern is the sum of the previous two numbers?  

```
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3 
2 + 3 = 5 
3 + 5 = 8 
…
```

Build a function to illustrate how to get this sequence to output. If you don’t know where to begin start with pseudo code to work through the steps.
